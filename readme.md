# Tango Test

![1](https://github.com/ispam/ZemogaApp/blob/master/gif/space_news.gif)

**Objective:** Build a REST app to show Articles and its details

## Architectural Pattern

** I choose to go with a MVVM pattern since for the app to build I believe its more suited**

The architectural pattern are presented by modules:
-	*Presentation Module:* This module includes all components related to the UI
-	*Domain Module:* This is an extension of the business logic, its commonly used to satisfy the business model.
-	*Data Module:* This module functionality allows the app to have a clear communication of what to read and delete
-   *Common Module:* This module is in charge to hold all the common extensions and other functions
-   *Di Module:* This module is responsible for dealing with all the dependency injections
-   *UI Module:* This module is for all the UI components
-   *Utils Module:* This module holds all utility classes
